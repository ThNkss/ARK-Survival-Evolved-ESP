This ESP allows players to locate literally every actor in the game — including dinos, players, and items — with precision and ease.

Toggle: Press INSERT to open/close the ESP menu.

Features: Fully customizable overlays, dynamic actor tracking, and real-time visualization.

This project was developed using reverse engineering techniques with ReClass.NET

, providing a deep understanding of Ark’s internal structures.
